## 平台工程
Platform engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal developer platforms (IDPs) for software delivery and life cycle management.
~ By Gartner

Platform engineering is the act of building tools and workflows that provide self-service capabilities to developers. Those tools and workflows are called an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

The definition of platform engineering is the continuous development, building, and maintenance of infrastructure (like toolchains and workflows) in order to build self-service solutions. That enables value stream development teams to deliver quickly and provide consistency to the rest of the organization.
