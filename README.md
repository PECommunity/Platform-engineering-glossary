## 平台工程
Platform engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal developer platforms (IDPs) for software delivery and life cycle management.
~ By Gartner

The definition of platform engineering is the continuous development, building, and maintenance of infrastructure (like toolchains and workflows) in order to build self-service solutions. That enables value stream development teams to deliver quickly and provide consistency to the rest of the organization.
